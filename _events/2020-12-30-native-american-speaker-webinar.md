  Join us in celebrating and amplifying the voices and history of Native American tribes local to our community and beyond. **You will be hearing from a professor of Native American culture and linguistics at SDSU and a local community leader who advocates for indigenous communities in areas of climate, racial, social, and economic justice, and a senior in high school whose Ted Talk focused on her own Native narrative.**
