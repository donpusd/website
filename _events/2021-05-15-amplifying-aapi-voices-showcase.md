  In the spirit of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we’re
  hosting our *first* in-person event: a showcase of AAPI Student Leaders with
  emotional presentations and a Q&A discussion. 


  The event is going to be held **Saturday, May 22nd, from 4:00-6:00**. Check in begins at 3:30. 


  **There will be a $5 entry fee**, plus any additional donations, and the event will take place at the Rancho Bernardo High School Performing Arts Center (PAC). *All proceeds will go to Asian American mental health organizations!* We’ll be following social distancing and mask mandates, so space is limited!
