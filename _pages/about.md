At DON PUSD, we are a district-wide movement with the goal of causing change in our high schools and middle schools, along with creating lasting impacts throughout the San Diego-area. In our local chapter, we have several key goals:

 > A) Awareness — Increase awareness among students and faculty about the harms of racism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice and microagressions.

 > B) Better courses — Push for more diverse and less Eurocentric courses like A.P. World History and an ethnic studies course.
 
 > C) Connections — Connect with Black Student Unions and other social justice clubs to spread our impacts and help even more people!
